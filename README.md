Some Cross Game Info:

The cards
Originally the game was played with the Hungarian playing cards (32 cards), but it can also be played with the normal Poker playing cards (52 cards excluding jokers). There are 4 suits (colors). 
Only 24 cards are used for the Cross game, 6 of each suit.

<ul>
<li> Nine	- 0 points </li>
<li> Jack	- 2 points </li>
<li> Queen - 3 points </li>
<li> King	- 4 points </li>
<li> Ten	- 10 points </li>
<li> Ace	- 11 points </li>
</ul>

Points & Values

A player collects all the cards from the hands he won, and sums up the card points. Additionally, the points awarded for the announcements he made are added to the sum. An announcement is made by a player when he owns a king and a queen of the same suit, leads the hand and plays one of the two cards from the mentioned pair. It doesnâ€™t matter if he wins the hand or not. The awarded points are:
40 points for king & queen, when the suit is trump
20 points for king & queen, when the suit is not the trump

If a player manages to make all the possible announcements(calls), he will get 40 + 20 + 20 +20 = 100 points.

What counts for the game score are the cross points. 1 cross point equals 33 card points. If the number of card points is between the correspondences below, only the complete number of cross points is awarded (for example, for 110 card points only 3 cross points are awarded). Thus the following correspondences:
<ul>
<li>1 cross point = 33 card points</li>
<li>2 cross points = 66 card points</li>
<li>3 cross points = 99 card points</li>
<li>4 cross points = 132 card points</li>
<li>5 cross points = 165 card points</li>
<li>6 cross points = 198 card points</li>
</ul>
